Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I predicted that the time would increase evenly with the number of simulations, but 100 simulations took a little less time than 10.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after 1000 simulations
