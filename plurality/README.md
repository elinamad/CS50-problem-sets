<h1>Plurality</h1>

This program is a simple implementation of a plurality vote election. The program first checks if the command-line argument for the number of candidates is valid, and then prompts the user to input the number of voters. After that, the program accepts the user's votes and updates the vote count for each candidate using the vote function. Finally, the program determines the winner(s) of the election by iterating over the candidates and printing out the candidate(s) with the most votes using the print_winner function. The program makes use of structs to represent the candidates and stores them in an array. The strcmp function is used to compare the candidate's name with the name entered by the user to register the vote. The program uses two for loops to sort the candidates by vote count in descending order, and then prints out the winner(s) by iterating over the sorted array of candidates.
