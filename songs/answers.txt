1) If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018 how would you characterize their audio aura ?

    Average energy = 0.65906
    Average danceability = 0.71646
    Average loudness = -5.67764
    Average speechiness = 0.115569
    Average valence = 0.484443
    Average tempo = 119.90418

    amount of songs with above average energy = 53
    amount of songs with above average danceability = 54
    amount of songs with above average loudness = 50
    amount of songs with above average speechiness = 35
    amount of songs with above average valence = 49
    amount of songs with above average tempo = 51

    top characteristics:

    1) danceability
    2) energy
    3) tempo
    4) loudness
    5) valence
    6) speechiness

    The listener (probably) prefers songs with high danceability and energy, they have an energetic musical aura


2) Hypothesize about why the way i've calculated this aura might not be very representative.

    there is no distinct prefference to one characteristic from the given above.
