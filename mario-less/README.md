<h1> Mario-less </h1>

This program creates a simple pyramid using '#' symbols based on user input. 

This program prompts the user to input an integer value between 1 and 8 (inclusive) representing the height of a pyramid. It then outputs a pyramid made of '#' symbols with the specified height.

To run the program, you need a C compiler, such as GCC or Clang, installed on your system. You can compile the program using the following command in your terminal:
<code>gcc -o mario mario.c -lcs50</code>

After compiling the program, you can run it using the following command:
<code>./mario</code>

The program will then prompt you to enter a value for the height of the pyramid. The program will validate that the value entered is within the range of 1-8, and prompt again if an invalid input is entered.

Once a valid input is entered, the program will output a pyramid made of '#' symbols with the specified height.

This program is a simple example of using loops in C to construct a pyramid.
